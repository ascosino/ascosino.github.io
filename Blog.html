                In that case, you know that the world is crazy at the moment with COVID-19; and in the United States, police brutality and racism are prevalent subjects. Please educate yourself and the people around you, and find ways that you can help to make a change because a lot of people are negatively impacted. This does not only apply to the United States, but all over the world. You should constantly be active in fighting for justice, not just when it's in the media or popular to do so.

                Each day I am in Germany, I feel myself easily adapting to the culture much more. I briefly spoke about not smiling at anyone who passes me by on the street in my last week’s entry, and it’s such a small detail of the culture here, but I pat myself on the back each time I resist in smiling at a stranger. Another aspect that I’ve been rewarding myself for is the idea of waiting for the Ampelmännchen to turn green before crossing the street. Coming to Germany, though there are definitely those who jaywalk, majority of the people that I see crossing streets abide with the law; this is a value that I have noticed within many Germans. Many people respect the law, and I enjoy seeing a bit more civilized citizens. I almost always wait for the Ampelmännchen to turn green before crossing the street, and hopefully this will help me become a better citizen when I return to the states.
                <br><br>
                Keeping personal space is a factor that I appreciate a lot from Germans. Last class, we talked about the different types of personal space, and I like the distance that they keep. I can almost always spot someone who is not a local by seeing how they treat their personal space and other people’s personal space. My values align with those of the Germans in terms of personal space because although I come from a country that is very physically loving and affectionate, we typically only do that with people we know and are comfortable with; I will not just hug a random stranger, and this is probably why I ignore those people at Boston University with the “Free Hugs” signs.
                <br><br>
                Another aspect that I appreciate about Germans is that they keep quiet and are not too loud in public places. Of course, there is a time and place for everything, although in general during the day, I like how when I am in the tram or a busy restaurant, people are usually quiet. Germans know when and where to be loud, and I really enjoy their values in this topic. When it is early in the morning, I obviously don’t want to hear loud noises when I am tired and thinking of wanting to go back to bed.
                <br><br>
                Coming from the one of the two karaoke hotspots in the world, the one value that I disagree with Germans is the karaoke style. Karaoke is meant to be a fun time with friends, and Germans just want to sing sad songs most of the time; a few are okay, but if it’s all that you want to sing, that takes the fun out of it. Outside my window at the Student Hotel, there are various street musicians that I hear and all they have ever sung were sad songs; I don’t always want to hear this type of music (though the song choices are really good from the street musicians). Last night, I went to Gutz for karaoke night, and I was considering not going because I was planning on not singing, although I’m glad I did because a lot of our study abroad group went early and requested down songs, so it felt like home and a lot of fun.

                Now that I have been in Dresden for about three and a half weeks, I am slowly getting into the honeymoon phase. I went to Köln for Karneval and had a fantastic time being with my friends and meeting Germans. I always thought that I like the fast-paced lifestyle of living in a large city in America, although I am becoming much more accustomed to the German lifestyle, especially staying in a cafe for hours chatting with someone. I really do enjoy sitting down and taking a breath every once in a while; it has made me realize that life does not have to be so fast. 
                <br><br>   
                I am also getting more accustomed to the winter weather in Dresden. It rains almost everyday, but there is always some sort of blue skies and sun at one point in the day. Most importantly, the weather in Dresden has made me realize that looking at the weather forecast in the morning does not matter; I will always have to prepare for some type of precipitation. 
                <br><br>
                Today I went and explored more of the area around my neighborhood, and I think that really made me like Dresden a lot. I did get a tour on one of my first days here, although wandering a bit mindlessly has led me to discover its charm. I never really thought about exploring my neighborhood for some odd reason, but I'm really glad I did today, even when it was raining. I typically don't like to go out when anything is falling from the sky, although I am very happy that I did. Dresden enchants me more and more each day.

                <br>
                I have now spent approximately two weeks in Dresden and so far, I have enjoyed my time here. There are a few cultural differences that I have noticed; some I like and others not so much. I don’t think that I’ve really experienced culture shock since I find myself easily adapting to everything. However, my experience coming to Germany has been a bit backwards; rather than beginning with the honeymoon phase, I started off not liking Germany and wanting to go home. Now, the longer I am here, the more I like it. The airport staff in Dresden were grumpy and not helpful, and may have indirectly insulted Richard and I. Now that I meet more locals, they are nice. I did not really have any stereotypes of Germans except the supposed harsh language and beer drinking. Now I will share the things I like and don’t like about Germany.
                <br><br>
                What I like:
                <ul>
                    <li>No small talk. I dislike small talk a lot and I appreciate people not having unsubstantial conversations with me.</li>
                    <li>No tipping. I eat out without as much guilt as I would have if I had to tip an astronomical amount of money like in the United States.</li>
                    <li>Spending hours at a restaurant. I really appreciate the more relaxed culture with food and people taking their time eating and chatting. In the U.S., I feel that the culture in general is to get in and get out as fast as you can; there’s no time to relax, it’s always grind time.</li>
                    <li>Grocery shopping every few days. I like how I have to grocery shop often because it gets me out of my room and it prevents me from feeling like I’m useless and wasting time inside.</li>
                    <li>Things are cheaper. I am so happy that I am in East Germany and items that I buy are exponentially cheaper than if I bought them in the U.S. or West Germany.</li>
                    <li>German food is really good. I have not had bad experiences with German food so far.</li>
                </ul>

                What I don't like:
                <ul>
                    <li>People smoke cigarettes all the time. With all the secondhand smoke that I’m inhaling, I would have probably shaved off 10 years off of my life by the time I leave Germany in June.</li>
                    <li>Everything is closed on Sunday. It’s a bit inconvenient and it’s something I can’t really grasp my head around. It makes me wonder what Germans do on Sunday.</li>
                    <li>(Good) Asian food is impossible to find. I know that I’m in Germany and I obviously can’t expect to eat Asian food in Germany, but it’s my one way of coping with homesickness.</li>
                    <li>A lot of places pay with cash. In Boston, it was convenient to pay everything with card and my wallet was super light; now, it’s burdened with the weight of coins.</li>
                    <li>Everyone is tall. I know that most people are taller than me in general, but I’m jealous of the height that Germans have.</li>
                    <li>It’s hard to find German food. I didn’t expect this to be a difficulty at all.</li>
                    <li>The absurd amount of Italian food. If I wanted Italian food, I would’ve gone to Italy.</li>
                </ul>
