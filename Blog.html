        I labeled this section my blog, but it will most likely have random things on here, like a post about my current situation, thoughts on what's going on in the world, what I've learned from experiences, etc.

        In that case, you know that the world is crazy at the moment with COVID-19; and in the United States, police brutality and racism are prevalent subjects. Please educate yourself and the people around you, and find ways that you can help to make a change because a lot of people are negatively impacted. This does not only apply to the United States, but all over the world. You should constantly be active in fighting for justice, not just when it's in the media or popular to do so.
